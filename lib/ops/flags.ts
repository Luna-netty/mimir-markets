/**
 * Feature flags and incident kill switches.
 *
 * The requirement that shapes this: during an incident, create / stake / copy /
 * x402 must be pausable **independently**. A single global "maintenance mode" is
 * useless in practice — if Horizon is unreachable and payment proofs cannot be
 * verified you want to stop selling paid endpoints while people can still settle
 * and withdraw, and if a pricing bug is found you want to stop new stakes without
 * freezing payouts.
 *
 * Two rules:
 *
 *  1. **Withdrawal is never pausable.** Users must always be able to pull a parked
 *     payout, even mid-incident. There is deliberately no switch for it — an
 *     operator cannot accidentally trap funds.
 *  2. **Read paths stay up.** Pausing writes must not blank the explorer, because a
 *     status page nobody can reach is not a status page.
 *
 * Env-driven so a switch can be flipped without a deploy.
