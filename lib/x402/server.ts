/**
 * Seller side of Mimir's paid resources — x402 v2 over `@x402/next`.
 *
 * Mimir declares what a route costs and who is paid; the Stellar scheme in
 * `./stellar-scheme.ts` does verification and settlement by reading the buyer's
 * payment back off Horizon. There is no facilitator hop and no third party in the
 * loop — see that module's header for why Stellar does not need one, and
 * {@link settlementIdentifier} for how replay is handled.
 *
 * Usage in a route handler:
 *   export const GET = paidRoute("premiumPrice", handler);
 *
 * For routes whose recipient depends on the request (a council persona is paid
 * directly), pass a dynamic payTo:
 *   export const GET = paidRoute("councilVote", handler, { payTo: resolvePersona });
